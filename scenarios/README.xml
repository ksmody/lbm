<!--

The following example shows how to set up a scenario file in xml.
Currently the root not is <scenario /> which requires the scenario name.
The name is used as the basis for output names of the vts files.

The only child of <scenario /> is <domain />, which must either take a
vtk-file containing vtk points in legacy format or the dimensions xl, yl, and zl.
Note that if vtk-file and dimensions are provided the latter is overridden by the vtk contents.

Within a domain, boundaries can be set. A boundary node has an extent attribute as well as
an condition attribute defining the non-fluid collision operator to apply to the respective cells.

For the extents, x0, xmax etc. can be used to assign a boundary condition to a whole boundary layer.

Alternatively, the extent can be given in the format "xbegin xend ybegin yend zbegin zend",
consisting of the ranges in each direction to which a boundary condition shall be applied.
Note that currently it is not possible to use arithmetic expressions or x0/xmax expressions
when this alternative format is used. One must also consider that xmax==xl+1 because of the
ghost layers introduced in each domain.

For the condition one may use the following boundary conditions:
- noslip
- freeslip
- inflow        - Takes additional attributes vx, vy, vz defining the inflow velocities.
                - May take optional attribute rho-ref defining the reference density (default: 1.0)
- outflow       - May take optional attribute rho-ref defining the reference density (default: 1.0)
- pressure      - Takes additional attribute rho-in defining the input density
- movingwall    - Takes additional attributes vx, vy, vz defining the wall velocities

<!-- NOTE: Don't use this file as input. It will not work properly since some boundaries are not set!!! -->
<scenario name="Example-scenario">
    <domain vtk-file="vtk-points-file.vtk">
    <!-- Alternatively -->
    <domain xl="40" yl="40" zl="40">
        <boundary extent="z0" condition="noslip" />
        <boundary extent="zmax"    condition="movingwall" vx="0.05" vy="0" vz="0" />
        <boundary extent="ymax"   condition="noslip" />
        <!-- The condition below expresses the same as the above condition with extent="ymax"
         but in the alternative format. Note that a more elaborated use of this notation
         allows for introducing more complex obstacles within the domain -->
        <boundary extent="0 41 41 41 0 41"   condition="noslip" />
    </domain>
</scenario>
